# reloqtr

With our capital cities overflowing, it's time for a mass sea change. Use Reloqtr to set your preferences and be connected to the hottest Australian towns and suburbs in regional areas. Goodbye morning commute!

Reloqtr is a mobile web app that takes a users preference and returns suburbs around ACT (for now, could be anywhere) that suit those preferences. 

The app requires the reloqtr_backend available here: https://github.com/Joelith/reloqtr_backend
